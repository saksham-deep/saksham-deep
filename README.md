## 📊 Project approach
Every project follows a disciplined, reproducible flow:

1. **Define the business question** — scope & success metrics.
2. **Prepare & validate data** — cleaning, type-casting, and handling edge cases.
3. **Explore** — EDA, segmentation, and initial hypothesis testing.
4. **Model & quantify** — aggregations, statistical testing, and simple predictive models when needed.
5. **Package insights** — visualizations, dashboards, and a short executive summary that recommends next steps.

The focus is always clarity, accuracy, and business relevance.
