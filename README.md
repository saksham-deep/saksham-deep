## Hi there!! I’m Saksham Deep

I build data analytics projects focused on structured problem-solving, clarity of insights, and practical decision support.

This repository space documents my work across real-world datasets, where I explore business questions, validate assumptions, and present findings in a clear, reproducible way.

## 📊 Project approach
Each project generally follows a disciplined flow:
1. Define the business or analytical question  
2. Prepare and validate the dataset  
3. Analyze patterns, trends, and exceptions  
4. Present results in a decision-friendly format  

The goal is always clarity, accuracy, and relevance.
